Hereâ€™s the updated version of the exercises without the complete solution, plus a hint for identifying even or odd numbers:

### Exercise 1: Basic Function Return
**Objective:** Learn how to write a basic function that returns a value.

**Instructions:**
1. Write a function named `greet` that takes no parameters.
2. Inside the function, return the string `"Hello, world!"`.
3. Call the function and log the result to the console.

```javascript
// Write your function here
```

**Hint:** Use the `return` keyword to send back a string when the function is called.

### Exercise 2: Function Returning a Sum
**Objective:** Practice returning a value by calculating a simple sum.

**Instructions:**
1. Write a function named `addNumbers` that takes two parameters: `num1` and `num2`.
2. Inside the function, return the sum of `num1` and `num2`.
3. Call the function with the values `10` and `5`, and log the result to the console.

```javascript
// Write your function here
```

**Hint:** The sum of two numbers can be found using the `+` operator.

### Exercise 3: Returning a Value Based on Condition
**Objective:** Write a function that returns a value based on a condition.

**Instructions:**
1. Write a function named `isEven` that takes a parameter `num`.
2. Inside the function, check if `num` is even.
3. If it is even, return `"Even"`; otherwise, return `"Odd"`.
4. Call the function with different values like `4` and `7`, and log the results to the console.

```javascript
// Write your function here
```

**Hint:** Use the modulus operator (`%`) to determine if a number is even or odd. If a number divided by 2 leaves a remainder of 0, it's even.

These exercises now encourage students to solve the problems themselves while giving them hints to guide their thinking.
